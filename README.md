# Multiuser_Dungeon
This is a virtual world made up of unit rooms where each room is
either transparent or solid. 


We can move in any of these 6 directions: north, south,
east, west, up, down. Each move is considered to take exactly one room and we can
move only through transparent rooms.
When in a room, we can see a description of the room and anything or anyone else in
that room. 


You can interact with other people by typing say <message> into a command prompt.
This will send a chat message to everyone in the room you are in. 
  
  
You can alternatively choose to type.Â  Moreover, you can type yell <dialog> 
to yell across the entire world. Other commands include <direction> to move around,
such as "north", "east".
